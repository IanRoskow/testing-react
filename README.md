# Testing React and Redux with Jest and Enzyme

This project was created to do a simple example using jest and enzyme. This project was based on Stephen Griders Advanced React Redux course, but I modified the code to use Hooks rather than classes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
This will run all 6 test suites with a total of 12 passing tests.
